### FAQ
- **When will development of this project begin?**
  Actual Development won't begin until I feel satisfied with the status of [Metallurgy 4: Reforged](https://github.com/Davoleo/Metallurgy-4-Reforged).

- **What Minecraft version will this be available for?**
  It'll be available for the more recent versions of Minecraft (no 1.12.2), can't say much until development doesn't begin, but maybe we'll start before post-1.16 versions are released

- **What about Metallurgy 4: Reforged?**
  There won't be any port of M4R to later versions of Minecraft for a couple of reasons: <br>
  1. We're the only ones that were specifically allowed to develop a port of Metallurgy directly by the original author (ShadowClaimer)
  2. ShadowClaimer himself is working on a new official version of Metallurgy for the newer versions of Minecraft (more information on his discord server)
  3. In conclusion we won't allow any port both to newer version of Forge, Fabric or any other modloader.

- **Why are you starting again from scratch?**
  Metallurgy 4: Reforged started out as project that was meant to built upon what was established with Metallurgy but we decided to take it one step further... and to make it more independent than it was before.
  Since the core focus of  Metallurgy 4: Reforged project is to bring back Metallurgy 4 features to newer versions of minecraft we felt like keeping that name would tie us to some constraints and therefore we chose to start anew.
  Another reason why we've chosen to start from scratch other than the core purpose of the mod changing is that ShadowClaimer is working on an official updated version of Metallurgy for the newer versions of Minecraft.
